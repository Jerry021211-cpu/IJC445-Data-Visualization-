# Hong Kong Air Quality Spatial-Temporal Visualization
This is a data visualization project for the IJC445 course, focusing on air quality variations across Hong Kong’s urban and suburban areas. It transforms pollutant datasets (PM2.5, NO₂, O₃) into intuitive visuals to present regional/seasonal concentration differences.

All R code used to generate the composite visualizations is provided in this repository for reference.
